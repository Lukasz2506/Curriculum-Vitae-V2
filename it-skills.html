          <h3>SQL</h3>
          <p>
            One of the ability I gained to my IT skills portfolio was the basics
            of SQL. To achieve this aim I graduated a udemy course leading by
            Jose Portilla,

            >
            I have learned there how to move around on the PostGreSQL, typical
            clauses which allows to work on the already existing databases like
            SELECT, HAVING, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, JOINs etc. Moreoveer I got to
            know how to create simple tables using reliable constraints, and SQL
            datatyes.

          <h3>Linux Command Line</h3>
          <p>
            The second basic konwledge I thought might be essential in IT work
            was how to move around on the command line interface using Linux.
            That is why I made a

          <h3>Python</h3>
          <p>
            This is a language I have started my programming journey with. The
            first course I have passed and where I got to know what programming
            really is was

              >Python dla początkujących.</a
            >
            Here I meet for the first time totally basic stuff like variables,
            datatypes, conditions, arrays, loops, functions and also a few
            modules and libraries which is very common and usefull. Next setp I
            have made in this direction was to passed a basic Python course but
            in English.

            let me got to know programming language better, and to making a new
            tasks using similar tools. Here I also met for the first time with
            the Class statement. The last Python course I have made in 100% was

              >The Complete Python Bootcamp</a
            >
            Here I better got to konw OOP, how to handling errors and exceptions
            and a few fields where python might be used in real programmer life
            like web scrapping. Baside of that there was few courses I made
            pratially. Some of the projects I have made using Python you can

          <h3>Web Development</h3>
          <p>
            The way which seemed to me the most interesting was Web Development.
            This is why I decided to start study in this direction. Before I
            have wokred on that, I started online course to improve my Web
            knowledge. Very usefull was
            <a

              >The complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp</a
            >
            I have already made in 50%. It helped me to know HTML and CSS.
            Moreover I discovered a magic really exist using bootstrap
            framework. Next was the Java Script language. After many hours spent
            with Python, the JS learning went relatively fast. Next step was
            jQuery, which showed me that commands might be really short and
            easy, but honestly I would prefer pure JS. Furthermore I have got to
            know basics of backend with Node.JS and Express. Now during my study
            I hetting to know a basics of my first serious framework Vue.JS It
            is impressive how it can make the programmer wors so efficient but
            it also teach humility for synthax.
