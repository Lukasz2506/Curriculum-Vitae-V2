          <h3>Synthos S.A.</h3>
          <p>
            The first job I have got, on my last semester of UoT studies was an
            Application Technician in Research and Development Department in one
            of the biggest chemical factory in Poland, Synthos. I remember the
            moment when I was synthetising PU for my MoS diploma and the unknow
            number interrupt the silence. Because I predicted that this might be
            a response from my future employer, I ran onto the hall a pick up
            the phone. That was the circumstances I got my first job, straightly
            connected with studies, and I was very exciting. The next 9 months
            of work in Synthos was the best labolatory workshop I have ever had.
            I constantly took part to prepare a rubber compounds, executed a
            crosslinking process, and made a laboratory analysis of the samples
            I have prepared before, like stress-strain measures, DMA phase
            charts, abrasion tests, viscosity measurements and many more. Beside
            of work I have known myself better, and I realized that from the
            perspective living on the second end of the country, far away from
            home and friends wasn't a good solution for me. That is why I
            started looking for a new place to develop myself...

          <h3>Bridgestone</h3>
          <p>
            I found it relatively fast. I came across a job offer of one of the
            biggest tires producer in the world. I thought that it might be a
            good opportunity to develop continously. Moreover, the distance from
            Stargard where the plant is located and my hometown Chojnice was 200
            kilometers instead of 550 from Synthos, and around 300 for Gda≈Ñsk
            were my girlfriend has already lived. At that moment this solution
            looked perfect, comapring to the situation I have been. After a
            short time I realised that it wasn't. Finding an apartment in
            Stargard was very difficult, and the closest place I found a room
            was Szczecin, which gives me additionally 50 kilometers against my
            first estimations. Furthermore, 90 kilometers round-trip every day
            also wasn't convenient solution, especially that I started the new
            job on January, where the days are very short.<br />
            The work itself in the Bridgestone plant was very interesting
            excperience for me. The production scale was enormous. I was a
            member of R&D and one of three people extrusion subteam. I took part
            in new compound extrusion trials and putting the parameters into the
            system. It gives me a completley different perspective of work
            connected with elastomers - commercial scale.

          <h3>Dr. Oetker</h3>
          <p>
            Finally I reorganised my priorities, and I found a job in my lovely
            3City. My new workplace was Dr. Oetker ambient food plant in Gda≈Ñsk,
            and here I work until now. I am responsible here about packaging
            development. The projects I take part concerns quality, savings and
            processing optimisations regarding a whole packaging portfolio like
            flexibles, folding boxes, corrugated and labels. I am in contact
            with packaging suppliers, preparing and managing packaging
            specifications, organise and coordinate a packaging trials on the
            production. If it is needed, I also execute a laboratory
            measurements like friction coefficient, sealability and others. This
            sweet journey last almost 8 years for now. Maybe it is time to
            change something and move out of the box I sit from quite long time?
