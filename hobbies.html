          <h3>Hiking</h3>
          <p>
            One of my favourite way to spend my free time is hiking, especially
            in the mountains. I really appreciate the hudge space and the
            freedom I feel in this nature circumstances. If it would be
            possible, I would bring them a little bit closer to the 3City
            therefore I can enjoy it more often. <br />
            I like to plan some specific trail and come it across for a few
            days, sleeping independently of commercial places. The time limit
            allows me to know better my surroundings. One of the biggest
            domestic challanges was to made

            which was really beautifull and on some trail sections it reminds
            Beskidy Mountains.

          <h3>Buschcraft</h3>
          <p>
            I really enjoy spending nights outdoor. That is the main reason I
            start camping in the forest. The silence mixed with the rustle of
            trees and the sounds of animals is something anusual. Sitting close
            to the fire in the camp where every inch aside the temperature the
            temperature decreasing rapidly has something magical. Sometimes the
            camping is the way to meet with a friends and spend time together
            instead of crowded bar in the citycenter, and it works really well.
            It is also a good opportunity to train some survival technicqes like
            making fire or practice to tight a knots. There is alway somettginh
            tasty to eat. Everyone cooking something delicious on the fire and
            share together their meals and recipes.

          <h3>Music</h3>
          <p>
            I always wanted to play one the giutar. When I was a child I love to
            listen my Grandpa playing on the bass guitar and my uncle, his son,
            who playing electric guitar. He always impressed me of his style. A
            long hair and the black outfit with the best metal bands on the
            front. I remember when I was six he gave me a shirt with a big
            violate skull and metallica signature. We even have a photo sitting
            together wearing the same shirts. Unfortunatelly I cannot find this
            photo. <br />
            When I was nine my biggest desire was to learn playing giutar. That
            is why I enrolled a music school. Two first years of my music
            journey I was very focused on training many boring exercising. I
            still waited when I would have started play metallica or slayer
            songs. After this time I realised that it will not happened in this
            place. The dissapointment was the reason I am didn't pay much
            attention to the music school any more. The breakpoint was a high
            school. Because of the people who surrounded me I returned to
            playing on my own rules and start practise a music I really wanted
            to play. After a few months we started a band. We got a place for
            practice in House of Cultire in Ogorzeliny. In the two years when
            the band exists we play on the few public events which was very nice
            experience. <br />
            Nowadays I only play for my own but I still really like it and it
            brings me a nice memories.
