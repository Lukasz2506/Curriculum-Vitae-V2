          <h3>Synthos S.A.</h3>
          <p>
            The first job I have got, on my last semester of UoT studies was an
            Application Technician in Research and Development Department in one
            of the biggest chemical factory in Poland, Synthos. I remember the
            moment when I was synthetising PU for my MoS diploma and the unknow
            number interrupt the silence. Because I predicted that this might be
            a response from my future employer, I ran onto the hall and pick up
            the phone. That was the circumstances I got my first job, straightly
            connected with studies, and I was very exciting. The next 9 months
            of work in Synthos was the best labolatory workshop I have ever had.
            I constantly took part to prepare a rubber compounds, executed a
            crosslinking process, and made a laboratory analysis of the samples
            I have prepared before, like stress-strain measures, DMA phase
            charts, abrasion tests, viscosity measurements and many more.

          <h3>Bridgestone</h3>
          <p>
            My next work experience was the job in one of the biggest tires
            producer in the world. I thought that it might be a good opportunity
            to develop continously. The work itself in the Bridgestone plant was
            very interesting excperience for me. The production scale was
            enormous. I was a member of R&D and one of three people extrusion
            subteam. I took part in new compound extrusion trials and putting
            the parameters into the system. It gives me a completley different
            perspective of work connected with elastomers - commercial scale.
            Unfortumatelly due to personal reasons I have changed my work plans
            and returned to Gdańsk.

          <h3>Dr. Oetker</h3>
          <p>
            Finally I I found a job in the 3City. My new workplace was Dr.
            Oetker ambient food plant in Gdańsk, and here I work until now. I am
            responsible about packaging development. The projects I take part
            concerns quality, savings and processing optimisations regarding a
            whole packaging portfolio like flexibles, folding boxes, corrugated
            and labels. I am in contact with packaging suppliers, preparing and
            managing packaging specifications, organise and coordinate a
            packaging trials on the production. If it is needed, I also execute
            a laboratory measurements like friction coefficient, sealability and
            others. I take part in a few big projects from the areas like
            packaging machine purchasing, sustainability etc. My current work
            gives an opportunituies where I can use various techniques from
            project management or problem solving methods. From a few years, due
            to the new environmantal legislations, a big part of my work time
            was filled by sustainability projects (weight opitimising,
            redefinging packaging structures, recyclability). I think this is
            very interesting area. One of the main think it teach me is to have
            a holistic approach aiming the goals.
